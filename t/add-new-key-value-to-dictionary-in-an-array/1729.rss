    <title>Add new key/value to dictionary in an array</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/add-new-key-value-to-dictionary-in-an-array/1729</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking to be able to add a new key and value to a dictionary/object that is located in an array of dictionaries/objects, but I&#39;m struggling at how to do so.

Scenario:

I&#39;m looking to build a workflow that will deploy a VM and then make some adjustments inside the VM after deployment. Ideally, I would like to pass an array of dictionaries/objects to be able to deploy multiple VMs at once using &quot;with items&quot; in the tasks.

Below is an example of what I&#39;m looking to pass to the workflow:

```
[
  {
   &quot;Domain&quot; : &quot;example1.com&quot;,
   &quot;Param1&quot; : &quot;burger1&quot;,
   &quot;Param2&quot; : &quot;hotdog1&quot;,
   &quot;Param3&quot; : &quot;soda1&quot;
  },
  {
   &quot;Domain&quot; : &quot;example2.com&quot;,
   &quot;Param1&quot; : &quot;burger2&quot;,
   &quot;Param2&quot; : &quot;hotdog2&quot;,
   &quot;Param3&quot; : &quot;soda2&quot;
  },
  {
   &quot;Domain&quot; : &quot;example3.com&quot;,
   &quot;Param1&quot; : &quot;burger3&quot;,
   &quot;Param2&quot; : &quot;hotdog3&quot;,
   &quot;Param3&quot; : &quot;soda3&quot;
  }
 ]
```
The issue is that the IP address to access the VM isn&#39;t known until the VM is deployed. What I would like to do is add the IP to the dictionary used to deploy the VM, such as going from:
```
{
 &quot;Domain&quot; : &quot;example1.com&quot;,
 &quot;Param1&quot; : &quot;burger1&quot;,
 &quot;Param2&quot; : &quot;hotdog1&quot;,
 &quot;Param3&quot; : &quot;soda1&quot;
}
```
to:
```
{
 &quot;Domain&quot; : &quot;example1.com&quot;,
 &quot;Param1&quot; : &quot;burger1&quot;,
 &quot;Param2&quot; : &quot;hotdog1&quot;,
 &quot;Param3&quot; : &quot;soda1&quot;,
 &quot;IPAddress&quot; : &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
}
```
Has anyone added done this before and can point me in the direction I should head to achieve it?</description>
