    <title>Dependency in sensor&#39;s venv intersects with stackstorm internal python package</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/dependency-in-sensors-venv-intersects-with-stackstorm-internal-python-package/1521</link>
    <description>Hello!
I have &quot;cryptography&quot; module dependency in my sensor. I&#39;ve installed proper version of this library into my pack&#39;s virtual environment.
But i&#39;ve found that loaded version is from st2 sensor container environment.
Is there any way to totally isolate pack&#39;s venv?
Module reloading is not very helpful cause there a lot of submodules intersection in this library and also versions of C-bindings are in mismatch.</description>

            <p>Hello!<br>
I have “cryptography” module dependency in my sensor. I’ve installed proper version of this library into my pack’s virtual environment.<br>
But i’ve found that loaded version is from st2 sensor container environment.<br>
Is there any way to totally isolate pack’s venv?<br>
