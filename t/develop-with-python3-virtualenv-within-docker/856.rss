    <title>Develop with python3 virtualenv within docker</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/develop-with-python3-virtualenv-within-docker/856</link>
    <description>Hi there!
Has anyone tried developing Python Actions inside a stackstorm VM or the Docker image? 
I&#39;m currently attaching VisualStudio Code to the running container (with the Remote Development Extension), such that I can write new Actions without imports being underlined as errors, and to get &#39;autocomplete&#39; for the Python package `st2common` contents. 
To do that, I also configured the Pythonpath to `/opt/stackstorm/st2/bin/python`. If I see correctly, this is Python 2.7 (according to `python --version`) so I was wondering whether there&#39;s also virtualenv with Python 3 for this sort of development setup? The StackStorm version is 3.1.0, so Actions with Python 3 should be supported, if I see this correctly in the StackStorm [roadmap](https://docs.stackstorm.com/roadmap.html). 
Feedback, questions and comments are very welcome :)</description>

            <p>While the question about the ideal dependency management remains partially unresolved for me, I’ve now found the <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/packs.html#using-python-3-for-pack-python-virtual-environment" rel="nofollow noopener">crucial piece of documentation</a> regarding Python 3 virtual environments.</p>

            <p>Alternatively, it would be very nice to have a st2common python 3 package available via PyPI – I couldn’t find this so far and would greatly appreciate any pointers. (Developing in the st2 venv makes dependency management unpleasant, at least I’ve not found a good solution so far. Also this requires to backport the existing Action code from Python 3.6 to Python 2.7; apart from convenience, it would be nice to find a solution for this since Python 2.7 will be EOL at the end of this year.)</p>
<p>How have others dealt with this? Have you ignored the import errors while developing custom Python actions?</p>
