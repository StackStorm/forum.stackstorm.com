    <title>Execution of id of task in a workflow - invalid value being returend</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/execution-of-id-of-task-in-a-workflow-invalid-value-being-returend/1663</link>
    <description>Hi All,
I am trying to pass the execution id of an executed task to the next task. I found the details to perform this action here - https://docs.stackstorm.com/orquesta/stackstorm.html#stackstorm-context. But for some reason the execution id passed on to the next task is wrong ie it is not the same when i check in UI and the one returned is invalid (when i run $ st2 execution get &lt;execution_id&gt; )

Any pointers on this topic will help. The reason i am trying to do this is so that in the case of failures i can track the failed executions later.

Thanks</description>
