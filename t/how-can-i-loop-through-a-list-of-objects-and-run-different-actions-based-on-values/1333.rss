    <title>How can I loop through a list of objects and run different actions based on values?</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/how-can-i-loop-through-a-list-of-objects-and-run-different-actions-based-on-values/1333</link>
    <description>I have an action that returns a list of objects like:
`[{media: &quot;email&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;test&quot;}, {media: &quot;sms&quot;: &quot;content&quot;: &quot;short text&quot;}, ...]`

Now I need to iterate through all list objects and run target action based on the values in media. For the above example I need to get result().result and iterate through all and run `email` action, `sms` action, etc. Is this possible? Is there a better way of doing this in the workflow?

In fact I have one result but many actions will be run based on the values present in media.

    determine_media:
        action: mypack.determine_media
        input:
          media: &lt;% ctx().media %&gt;
        next:</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://github.com/alirezastack">@alirezastack</a> Yes that’s right, <code>result().result</code> part gets the result of <code>determine_media</code> action.</p>

            <p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="https://github.com/kyildiz">@kyildiz</a> ,<br>
Just this code section <code>result().result </code> is retrieved from the output of <code>determine_media</code> output?</p>

            <p>I assume that you have already defined <code>task</code> for <code>sms</code> and <code>email</code>. You can use <code>yaql</code> expression for filtering and assigning them to the different variable in the context. After that you can use those variables in the action tasks.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">determine_media:
  action: mypack.determine_media
  input:
    media: &lt;% ctx().media %&gt;
  next:
    - when: &lt;% succeeded() %&gt;
      - publish:
          - emails: &lt;% result().result.filter($.media = "email") %&gt;
          - smss: &lt;% result().result.filter($.media = "sms") %&gt;
    do:
      - email_task
      - sms_task

email_task:
  action: mypack.email_action
  input:
    media: &lt;% ctx().emails %&gt;
    
sms_task:
  action: mypack.sms_action
  input:
    media: &lt;% ctx().smss %&gt;
</code></pre>

            <p>I’m not sure of the best way.</p>
<p>One way - could be.</p>
<p>determine_media has 2 tasks after it - one for sms and one for email. Each of those is a loop over the with items with task(determine_media).result.  Those actions could be sub-workflows - whose first task just checks they are of the correct type and then goes onto your actual action.</p>
<p>Or you could probably with some Jinja or YAQL trickery take that result into two separate lists to parse through. And then have two with_items on the separate lists running in parallel.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://github.com/amanda11">@amanda11</a> thank you for your reply. What you are actually doing is that you are sending each item of the list to determine_media action itself. What I want to do is in fact to call different actions (after determine media) in parallel. Let’s say the output of determine_media action consists of sms and also email. Here I need to call email action and also sms action both in parallel. Is this possible?</p>
<p>I wanted to use chain for that but it seems to work linearly.</p>

            <p>In Orquesta workflows you have the with items concept, and you can then loop through the items. See: <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/orquesta/languages/orquesta.html#with-items-model" class="inline-onebox" rel="nofollow noopener">Orquesta Workflow Definition — StackStorm 3.2.0 documentation</a></p>
<p>So for example say you had that list of items stored in ctx().media_list by a publish from the previous task - or you can access a task’s result directly with task().result, you could use something similar to:</p>
<p>determine_media:<br>
action: mypack.determine_media<br>
input:<br>
media: &lt;% item(my_obj).media %&gt;<br>
with:<br>
items: my_obj in &lt;% ctx().media_list %&gt;</p>
