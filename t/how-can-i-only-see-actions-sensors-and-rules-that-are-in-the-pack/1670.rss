    <title>How can I ONLY see actions, sensors and rules that are in the pack?</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/how-can-i-only-see-actions-sensors-and-rules-that-are-in-the-pack/1670</link>
    <description>At my company we are trying to configure StackStorm to be a tool for normal (non-programmer) coworkers to be able to build workflows using the workflow editor. The idea is we would have us programmers create a pack of actions, rules and sensors of the common tasks a normal user would use.

We would like to simplify the UI as much as possible and only display a single pack for them to drag items from. I cannot seem to make StackStorm ONLY display from the custom pack. It either displays all actions or none.

Here is what I have tried so far.

* I have created a pack using the steps here under &quot;Creating Your First Pack&quot; https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/packs.html#creating-your-first-pack.

```
# /opt/stackstorm/packs/twenty20_solutions/pack.yaml
ref: twenty20_solution
name: Twenty20 Solutions
description: Workflow automation toolbox
keywords:
- twenty20
- solutions
version: 0.0.1
python_versions:
- &quot;3&quot;
author: Twenty20 Solutions
email: test@test.com
```

* I enabled RBAC in the st2.conf
```
[rbac]
enable = True
backend = default
```

* I created a role called the normal role
```
# /opt/stackstorm/rbac/roles/normal.yaml
---
name: &quot;normal&quot;
description: &quot;allowed ui workflow editor access&quot;
enabled: true
permission_grants:
# - permission_types: # commented global permissions
# - &quot;pack_list&quot;
# - &quot;action_list&quot;
- resource_uid: &quot;pack:twenty20_solutions&quot;
permission_types:
- &quot;pack_view&quot;
- resource_uid: &quot;action:twenty20_solutions&quot;
permission_types:
- &quot;action_view&quot;
```

* I created a user called &quot;nock&quot;

* I assigned the user nock to the role of normal
```
# /opt/stackstorm/rbac/assignments/nock.yaml
---
username: &quot;nock&quot;
description: &quot;trying to get this to work&quot;
enabled: true
roles:
- &quot;normal&quot;
```

After changes to the role, I run `st2-apply-rbac-definitions --config-file=/etc/st2/st2.conf`
```
eric@eric:/etc/st2$ st2-apply-rbac-definitions --config-file=/etc/st2/st2.conf

2021-04-27 17:08:45,672 INFO [-] Group to role map definitions synchronized.
```



After all this when I login as nock to the UI, all the rules are missing.
![no action|690x428](upload://zzP5GLZhiAd5CiPR52NpMltdamv.png) 

When I login as st2admin, I see all the rules from the custom pack.

If I uncomment the global permission in normal.yaml, I will see all the rules from all the packs.
![too much action|690x406](upload://iaWSXtSTeXH0Fsj3dM6qH9UXvQ0.png) 


I think the problem is with my normal.yaml role config.

If I add the admin role to nock in /opt/stackstorm/rbac/assignments/nock.yaml, I will see all packs, actions, etc. So I think the user part is set up correctly.

**How can I ONLY see actions, sensors and rules that are in the twenty20_solutions pack?**</description>
