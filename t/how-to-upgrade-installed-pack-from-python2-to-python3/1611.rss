    <title>How to upgrade installed pack from python2 to python3</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/how-to-upgrade-installed-pack-from-python2-to-python3/1611</link>
    <description>Recently, I am going to upgrade Stackstorm to 3.4. From release log，pack with python2 action runner is no longer support? I have 5 packs with python2, and have not certified with python3. I need to upgrade pack to python3 before Stackstorm upgrade. 

Could you provide document or instructions for pack upgrade?</description>

            <p>If you just have actions and not sensors, then on earlier StackStorm versions 3.3 etc, then you could install a pack and tell it to use python3. (As long as you had installed python3, and configured that option).<br>
There are some instructions on running with python3 on earlier STackStorms here: <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/3.3/packs.html#python-versions-in-pack-python-virtual-environment" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Packs — StackStorm 3.3.0 documentation</a></p>
