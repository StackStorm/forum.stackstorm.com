    <title>Keeping HA nodes in sync (non k8s)</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/keeping-ha-nodes-in-sync-non-k8s/1744</link>
    <description>I have multiple clusters and multiple nodes in each one. In the documentation it suggest keeping the packs and virutalenv in sync with something like Ansible but there&#39;s no suggestions on how one should do this. Any high-level suggestions on how to do this?</description>
