    <title>Multiple ssh connections in an action-chain</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/multiple-ssh-connections-in-an-action-chain/1406</link>
    <description>Hi,

I have an action-chain workflow with 5 actions.
Each action needs to send some CLI commands on a router (cisco/juniper).

We use paramiko to make connection to this router in every action ! For 5 actions I have to make and teardown ssh connection - 5 times which is not effective.

Is there a way to make connection only once and reuse it in subsequent actions?

I tried returning the ssh-connection-object in first action to reuse it in subsequent actions, but st2 doesn&#39;t recognize the type. Only string, object (JSON), integer are supported.

Thanks !</description>
