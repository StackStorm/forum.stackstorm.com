    <description>TEam,

I would be really greatfull to you in someone helps me with this current situation. i have one single jump server to get on to all the hosts in my environment. I had to know how to use my jump box as bastion host and trigger my automations on target hosts.

Command line arguments are working. but i am not able to figure out how to do in stackstorm.

ssh -q -i /root/ntp/id_rsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o &quot;proxycommand ssh -q -W %h:%p -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@jumpbox&quot; root@$vmname &lt; /root/ntp/actions/checkfix_ntp</description>
