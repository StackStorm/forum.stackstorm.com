    <description>We have been seeing few random instances where workflow execution went back to running state after it had completed and is stuck in running state after that.

Action execution log field:
[ { &quot;timestamp&quot; : ISODate(&quot;2021-03-27T13:24:52.932Z&quot;), &quot;status&quot; : &quot;requested&quot; }, { &quot;timestamp&quot; : ISODate(&quot;2021-03-27T13:24:54.938Z&quot;), &quot;status&quot; : &quot;scheduled&quot; }, { &quot;timestamp&quot; : ISODate(&quot;2021-03-27T13:25:00.200Z&quot;), &quot;status&quot; : &quot;running&quot; }, { &quot;timestamp&quot; : ISODate(&quot;2021-03-27T13:25:40.857Z&quot;), &quot;status&quot; : &quot;succeeded&quot; }, { &quot;timestamp&quot; : ISODate(&quot;2021-03-27T13:25:43.470Z&quot;), &quot;status&quot; : &quot;running&quot; } ]

Liveaction and workflow execution object are in succeeded state. The workflow calls an action which had completed at `end_timestamp: Sat, 27 Mar 2021 13:25:41 UTC` which is after the workflow had succeeded.
