    <title>Packs search takes 5 minutes to respond</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/packs-search-takes-5-minutes-to-respond/1651</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve deployed Stackstorm-HA (helm v0.60.0) and noticed that after logging into the Web UI that the Packs tab is completely blank while other tabs like Actions and Rules etc have all populated correctly 

I then discovered that /api/v1/packs/index returns a 504 response (/api/packs/ however returns my installed packs no problem)

On the cli if i run &quot;st2 pack search xxx&quot; then it does eventually return the result but it takes around 5mins to complete every time

I&#39;ve now enabled Debug mode and this is what I&#39;m seeing in the API service

    2021-04-16 03:30:48,279 DEBUG [-] Proxy configuration: {&#39;http_proxy&#39;: None, &#39;https_proxy&#39;: None, &#39;proxy_ca_bundle_path&#39;: None, &#39;no_proxy&#39;: None}
    2021-04-16 03:30:48,280 DEBUG [-] Starting new HTTPS connection (1): index.stackstorm.org:443
    2021-04-16 03:35:08,804 DEBUG [-] https://index.stackstorm.org:443 &quot;GET /v1/index.json HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 76037
    2021-04-16 03:35:08,812 DEBUG [-] Using response spec &quot;200&quot; for endpoint st2api.controllers.v1.packs:packs_controller.index.search.post and status code 200
    2021-04-16 03:35:08,813 DEBUG [-] Match path: /packs/index/search

I couldn&#39;t find any errors but I can see that it really is waiting 5 minutes between &quot;Starting new HTTPS Connection&quot; and actually issuing the GET request

If I run &#39;curl https://index.stackstorm.org/v1/index.json&#39; from the API container it pulls the full json file in less than a second so I don&#39;t understand why the API service is taking so long!

Any ideas?

Thanks,
