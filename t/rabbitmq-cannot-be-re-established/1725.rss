            <p>This looks like the message generated when the RabbitMQ service does not start.  I would check to make sure the service is running, restart it (if possible) and try again.  It does not say what version of ST2 or what OS it is being run on, but there was an issue with a Centos upgrade to RabbitMQ that caused it to not start properly.  The fix was to remove the one installed from the Centos repos and install the version distributed by RabbitMQ instead.</p>
