    <title>Rerun a mistral workflow from the last successful task to completion</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/rerun-a-mistral-workflow-from-the-last-successful-task-to-completion/331</link>
    <description>Now that I am running some production jobs in stackstorm, I have made an underlying fix to one of the sub tasks and would like to run the workflow from a specific sub_task to completion.  Is there a way to request that?  I know how to rerun the individual task, but how can I get it to finish the rest of the tasks that come after said task?

Cheers,

<p>Thanks for the assist, apparently, “Only tasks in error state can be rerun.”  While the task itself succeeded, it wasn’t successful in doing the proper processing due to a message that said, it wasn’t able to get a reservation.  I suppose I need to trap this message and have it fail properly not succeed, only then can I rerun with the --tasks.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
