    <title>Specify node for action</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/specify-node-for-action/1498</link>
    <description>Hi,
does anybody know if some progress has been made regarding https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/issues/3096 ?
We are in a similar case: 2 nodes, but some actions can only be run in one of them.
More specifically, we have one VM A in the cloud, and one VM B in our infrastructure (in a closed environment/network).
From our infrastructure, not all ports and protocols can be opened, so for instance, we would like to call some rest API from VM A, but make active-directory requests from VM B.
Currently we have managed to run the 2 VM in a HA setup, and hope that installing some packs only is VM A and others in VM B does the trick, but it failed. 
Is our use case possible? maybe a config/parameter to add the action call that we’ve missed?</description>
