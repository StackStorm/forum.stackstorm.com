    <title>Specifying with node an action is run on in an HA set up?</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/specifying-with-node-an-action-is-run-on-in-an-ha-set-up/1810</link>
    <description>I wanted to utilize this [reference](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html#reference-ha-setup) for HA set up but I had a more in depth question.

The HA set up will be in multiple DR sites. We need to make some optimizations to localize jobs to a certain site e.g. prevent jobs from being run on a us-east-node while interacting with hosts we have on us-west. Is this capability in StackStorm? or would be need some other solution like creating multiple st2 instances instead.

Thanks,
jeff</description>

            <p>Sadly, there is no way to distinguish between action runner nodes yet. All of them pick actions from a queue, with the assumption that all action runner nodes can handle all actions.</p>
<p>I would love to see this improved, but I have several other st2 improvements I’m working on, so I personally don’t have time to contribute this.</p>
<p>Would you have time, or would one of your colleagues have some time to work on this?</p>
<p>Here is some discussion about partitioning action runners / action runner affinity: <a href="https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/issues/3096" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Feature req: Partitioning actions to execute on separate nodes · Issue #3096 · StackStorm/st2 · GitHub</a></p>
