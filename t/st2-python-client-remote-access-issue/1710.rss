    <title>St2 python client remote access issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/st2-python-client-remote-access-issue/1710</link>
    <description>Hi, 
I am new to stackstorm. Trying out the st2client for the remote connectivity. I had some issue on the establishment. Apparently all others seem ok including the access through API, eg https://{host}/api. Would appreciate if anyone can give me some pointer.

**My client config is:**
    [general]
    base_url = https://192.168.1.3/api
    #api_version = v1
    # Path to the CA cert bundle used to validate the SSL certificates
    cacert =

    [cli]
    debug = True
    # True to cache the retrieved auth token during authentication in ~/.st2/token
    # and use the cached token in the subsequent API requests
    cache_token = True
    # Timezone used for timestamps displayed in the CLI. If not provided it defaults
    # to UTC
    timezone = Europe/Ljubljana

    [credentials]
    # Credentials used to authenticate against the auth API and retrieve the auth
    # token
    username = st2admin
    password = changeme

    [api]
    url = https://192.168.1.3:9101/api
    # or for a remote instance
    # url = https://example.com/api/v1

    [auth]
    url = https://192.168.1.2:9100/auth
    # or for a remote instance
    #url = https://example.com/auth/v1

    [stream]
    url = http://192.168.1.2:9102
    # or for a remote instance
    # url = https://example.com/stream/v1

**Issue:**
~/st2client/.st2#  st2 --config-file=./config action list
2021-05-18 09:48:45,777  WARNING - Auth API server is not available, skipping authentication.

            <p>It’s really difficult to help users with networking issues, because the situation is usually so fact-specific that it’s practically impossible for outsiders to know the solution, but I’ll do my best to guess.</p>
<p>Double check that the <code>general.base_url</code> should contain the <code>/api</code> path.</p>
<p>That is not the default password in the <code>[credentials]</code> section. Look closely at the <a href="https://docs.stackstorm.com/authentication.html?highlight=st2admin#authentication">authentication docs</a>, and remember that passwords are case sensitive.</p>
<p>Why do you have different IPs for the ST2 server? Simple ST2 deployments are usually run on one single host.</p>
<p>Have you double checked that you can ping both of those IP addresses? Can you SSH into those servers and check what ports are open? And what is the nginx config on the ST2 server/s?</p>
<p>Your client config might be off a little bit.</p>
<p>The default nginx config for ST2 rewrites some paths to specific ports (without paths), like this for the ST2 server itself:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/api --&gt; https://localhost:9101

/auth --&gt; https://localhost:9100

/stream/v1 --&gt; http://localhost:9102
</code></pre>
<p>So you might want to try something like this for your client:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[api]
url = https://192.168.1.3:9101  # &lt;-- Also: double check this IP address
# or for a remote instance
# url = https://example.com/api/v1

[auth]
url = https://192.168.1.2:9100
# or for a remote instance
#url = https://example.com/auth/v1

[stream]
url = http://192.168.1.2:9102
# or for a remote instance
# url = https://example.com/stream/v1
</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, run the <code>st2</code> client with the <code>--debug</code> flag to see the equivalent <code>curl</code> commands. That will help you debug the situation.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
