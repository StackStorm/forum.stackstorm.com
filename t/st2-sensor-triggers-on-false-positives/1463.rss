    <title>ST2 sensor triggers on false positives</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/st2-sensor-triggers-on-false-positives/1463</link>
    <description>Hi All,

We have implemented a solution with custom sensors where it watches to Kubernetes CRD object changes and create AWS resources based on that. It has been working fine for sometime now. Suddenly it triggered without any changes to the K8s CRD object. It happened twice apart within 8hrs and with the same pattern.  We didn&#39;t notice any anomalies in the logs and it shows as trigger was invoked by the sensor.

Has anybody noticed similar kind of behavior with sensors?
