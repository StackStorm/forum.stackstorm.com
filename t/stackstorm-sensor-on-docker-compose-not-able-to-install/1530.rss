    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/stackstorm-sensor-on-docker-compose-not-able-to-install/1530</link>
    <description>I have installed stackstorm on docker-compose. And I am trying to setup a sensor that polls a unix folder. I am able to create a shared folder that is shared within the docker and outside. But somehow when i install the docker the rule says missing trigger. The sensor will not be installed . Not sure how to proceed</description>
