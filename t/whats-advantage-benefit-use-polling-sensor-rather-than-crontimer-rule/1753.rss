    <title>What&#39;s advantage(benefit) use (polling)sensor rather than (CronTimer)rule?</title>
    <link>https://forum.stackstorm.com/t/whats-advantage-benefit-use-polling-sensor-rather-than-crontimer-rule/1753</link>
    <description>For example，
I want to know the new JIRA ticket.
I can write a pollingsensor with 5 minutes poll_interval, send a json format string trigger, and then filter by rules, at latest a workflow will handle the new ticket.
Why don&#39;t I just write a CronTimer rule which execute a workflow can query and process every 5 minutes?</description>

            <p>There’s been some discussion on this in the past on the forums. Both ways work.</p>
<p>One thing to consider is that if you have an interval timer running, and doing a query on the tickets then this could mean you have alot of workflows being executed doing not alot - and appearing in your execution list (on UI and CLI).</p>
<p>But if you had a polling sensor that only sent the trigger when a new ticket was found, then you’d only see executions for new tickets.</p>
